# Home-Automation
Home automation to a system capable of automate a house or building including energy management, security, comfort and communication. It can be integrated through wired or wireless communication networks. We designed a basic house operating model using various tested components  (LM-35, LDR sensor, IR sensors, LED etc.) and has been implemented further in our project.
